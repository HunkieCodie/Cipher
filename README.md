This is a simple Cipher tool written in JAVA to encrypt a string of text.
This tool also take in an encrpted string of text and decrypts it too.
This was written in response to the Terragon Ife Group questions to join the team.


The Caesar Cipher is a famous implementation of early day encryption. 
It would take a sentence and reorganize it based on a key that is enacted upon the alphabet. 
This makes it difficult to read and allows messages to be passed undetected.


The steps used in the program:

Step 1: Identify the character within the sentence.

Step 2: Find that characterâ€™s location within the alphabet.

Step 3: Identify that characters location + the key in the alphabet.

Step 4: Build a new sentence using the new characters in place of the original characters.

Step 5: repeat until sentence length is reached. (For loop).

Step 6: return result.
